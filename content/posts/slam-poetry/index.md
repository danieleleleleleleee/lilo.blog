![](<>)![](<>)![](<>)As cold winds encourage the trees to dance in the night sky,

![](<>)![](<>)![](<>)![](<>)I am more than glad to be inside.

![](<>)![](<>)![](<>)The warmth of burning wood caressing my skin,

![](<>)![](<>)![](<>)![](<>)![](<>)![](<>)With a silky-smooth blanket cradling me in. 

![](<>)![](<>)![](<>)![](<>)Feeling like a newborn baby, 

I sit here and can’t help but grin. 



I hear church bells singing in the distance,

Wow, I am so thankful for my existence.

![](<>)The words of the preachers being heard by all creatures, 

What wonderful teachers. 



![](<>)![](<>)Ding! 



![](<>)A sweet smell spills out of the kitchen. 

![](<>)The smell of cocoa and cinnamon fills the air. 

![](<>)![](<>)My tummy grumbles with delight, 

![](<>)![](<>)Oh I am ready for the first bite. 

What a captivating experience each delicacy holds,

I can’t help but yearn for more.
