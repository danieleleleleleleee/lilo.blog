Cold. Ice cold. Ice cold winds encourage the trees to dance in the night sky.

Oh for now i am more than glad to stay inside. 

From the comfort of my own home, 

I feel the warmth of burning wood caressing my skin, 

With a silky-smooth blanket cradling me in. 

Immersed, i feel like a newborn baby, 

But with my tea more like eighty. 



Hearing churchbells singing in the distance,

I am so thankful for my existance. 

The words of the preachers being heard by all creatures, 

What wonderful teachers. 



Ding!



A sweet smell spills out of the kitchen. 

The smell of cocoa and cinnamon fills the air.

My tummy grumbles with delight, 

I am ready for the first bite 

What a captivating experience each delicacy has in store, 

I can't help but yearn for more. 

Cold. Ice cold. Ice cold winters that fly by, 

Sometimes even as fast as a butterfly.
